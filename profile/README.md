## Welcome to the Project Babble Github page!

Project Babble is an open-source project aiming to bring robust lower-face expression tracking to VR headsets, agnostic of platform or hardware.

On our Github we have links to the [Project Babble](https://github.com/Project-Babble/ProjectBabble) desktop application, [documentation](https://babble.diy/) for users and developers, links to [3D prints](https://github.com/Project-Babble/BabbleHardware) for your type of headset, and links to our socials.
